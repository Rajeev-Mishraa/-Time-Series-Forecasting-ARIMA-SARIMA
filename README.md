🚀 Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA & SARIMA | Predicting Airline Passengers ✈️📈

This repository contains a comprehensive project on Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA models to predict the number of airline passengers. The project includes data preprocessing, stationarity tests, model selection, evaluation, and future forecasting.

Key Features:
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing time series trends
✅ Stationarity Check – ADF test and differencing
✅ ARIMA & SARIMA Implementation – Optimizing p, d, q parameters
✅ Model Performance Evaluation – MSE, RMSE, MAE
✅ Future Predictions – Forecasting upcoming airline passenger trends


📌 How to Use:
1️⃣ Clone the repository
2️⃣ Install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
3️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis
